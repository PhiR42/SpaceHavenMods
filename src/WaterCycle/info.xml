  <description>Changes the water processing to relieve logistics
  
  The underlying philosophy:
  - Ice and water have the same density, which leads to 1 ice being purified into 1 water instead of 5
  - some processes are updated to keep the economy in balance (all water requirements divided by 5). O2 balance shouldn't change. 
  
  Additions:
  - crops have also been tweaked to be more unique. Vegs have the best output/water, fruits are a bit slower, and meat needs chemicals as well as water. 
  - it is now possible to recycle human and monster meat to water and carbon or chemicals respectively. 
  - trading prices should correlate with the rarity/usefulness of an item, so water should be more expensive than ice (energy cost)
  - Vegs are new cheaper than Fruits, which are cheaper than meat to reflect cost/time of growing
