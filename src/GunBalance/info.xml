  <description>Updates the guns for more realistic balance
  	Pistol should be generally weak, but still decent until medium range
  	Shotgun devastating at short ranges but mediocre further
  	SMG balanced
  	Assault Rifle good at all distances, but dominating at long distances by reliably landing shots. At short distances, SMGs and shotguns will do more damage during the 1st exchange of fire. 
  	
  	KNOWN ISSUES: It seems each bullet hit (no matter how small) will trigger a surrender roll. I've made the shotgun shoot LESS pellets instead more to account for this
