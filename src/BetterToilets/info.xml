  <description>Adds two new toilet models:
  	- X0 Toilet one block basic toilet with no recycling at all
  	- X2 Toilet with better water recycling capability
  
  This should also serve as an tutorial for modders as it both modifies existing textures and add new ones. XML files are heavily commented with explainations.

   - construction animation on the new elements in the X2 toilet (drums at the back)
