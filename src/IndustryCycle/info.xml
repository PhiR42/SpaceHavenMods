    THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, MOSTLY FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES
    Changes the industry tree to be more in line with what one would expect from known engineering:  
  
  The underlying ideas:
  - matter should be roughly conserved (minus manufacturing losses)
  - trading prices should correlate with the rarity/usefulness of an item
  
  Regarding energy rods, those are now 5 times less abundant, but the power generators have been updated to reflect that, they'll consume rods 5 times slower (less logistics).
