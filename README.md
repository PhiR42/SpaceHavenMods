# SpaceHavenMods
Some Space Haven mods I made

## Better Toilets
Adds two new toilet models:
- X0 Toilet one block basic toilet with no recycling at all
- X2 Toilet with better water recycling capability  
  This should also serve as an tutorial for modders as it both modifies existing textures and add new ones. XML files are heavily commented with explainations. 
  
## Gun Balance
Updates the guns for more realistic balance:
- Pistol should be generally weak, but still decent until medium range
- Shotgun devastating at short ranges but mediocre further
- SMG balanced
- Assault Rifle good at all distances, but dominating at long distances by reliably landing shots. At short distances, SMGs and shotguns will do more damage during the first exchange of fire. 
    
## Water Cycle
Changes the water processing to relieve logistics
  
  The underlying ideas:
  - Ice and water have the same density, which leads to 1 ice being purified into 1 water instead of 5
  - some processes are updated to keep the economy in balance. O2 balance shouldn't change. 
  - crops have also been tweaked to be more unique. Vegs have the best output/water, fruits are a bit slower, and meat needs chemicals as well as water. 
  - trading prices should correlate with the rarity/usefulness of an item, so water should be more expensive than ice (energy cost)
  - Vegs are new cheaper than Fruits, which are cheaper than meat to reflect cost/time of growing
